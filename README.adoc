Extruder
========

Overview
--------

Extruder is a mail processing framework.  It uses Ruby's mail gem to parse the
mail, and then passes it through a series of processors to extract data from it.
This metadata can then be used to generate reports or filter files.

It is currently in a very preliminary stage; consider this an alpha.
